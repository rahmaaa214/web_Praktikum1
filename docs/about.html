    <p> <b>Hello !</b>Im the first daughter in my family and i have been wandering for <i>8 years</i>
         and still counting until now. I would like to explore new things, but sometimes that make me so tired.
          and of course don't forget to enjoy my free time with my family and friends.
          Because i think spending time with friends makes tiredness disappear, and we can exchange stories with each other.
        I like to share a positive expression because that can covered my sadness side :) </p>
<br>
          <p>Now just click my first photo and you can see the good <b>news</b> :)</p>
